# PowerShell-Functions

Repository is used to store and shared useful PowerShell functions that have been developed to serve a specific purpose.

Functions in the repository are usually ported into my PowerShell modules but are also made available as *single* files for easier download in case the whole module is not needed.

## Current available functions

- **[New-Timer](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/PowerShell-Functions/blob/master/New-Timer.ps1)** used to instantiate and start a new StopWatch timer object

- **[Get-ElapsedTime](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/PowerShell-Functions/blob/master/Get-ElapsedTime.ps1)** used to return information about a StopWatch timer object

- **[Stop-Timer](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/PowerShell-Functions/blob/master/Stop-Timer.ps1)** used to halt and existing StopWatch timer object

- **[Get-TimerStatus](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/PowerShell-Functions/blob/master/Get-TimerStatus.ps1)** used to get status of an existing StopWatch timer object
